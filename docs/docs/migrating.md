# Migrating from Gmail2GDrive

Make sure, you've done the initial [Getting Started](getting-started.md#use-a-library-reference-recommended) steps before migrating the old configuration to the new format.

The [Playground](/playground) provides a convenient way to migrate your old GMail2GDrive configuration to the new format of Gmail Processor by following these steps:

1. Copy the JSON configuration from GMail2GDrive (just the config, not the full code!) to the clipboard.
2. Use the paste action (ðŸ“‹) in the config toolbar to paste the config into the editor.
3. Convert the config using the convert action (ðŸ”„) to transform the configuration into the new Gmail Processor format.
4. Copy the full executable code (ðŸš€) and paste it into `Code.gs` of Google Apps Script.

If you want to manually convert your configuration or need to understand how the transformation is done have a look at [V1ToV2Converter.ts](https://github.com/ahochsteger/gmail-processor/blob/main/src/lib/config/v1/V1ToV2Converter.ts) that implements the conversion logic.
